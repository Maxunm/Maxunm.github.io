## Microcontroller Applications
Wew, this post has been a really long time coming. With these uncertain and unemployed times I've had the time to compile all of the assignments from my Microprocessor Applications class. 

This should be a mostly complete list of all of the projects that my lab partner and I completed during the semester. I have attempted to organize them so that they appear generally in order of "Difficulty" or logical groups that have related technologies.

During my time in this class I learned a great number of things with interfacing microcontrollers and their various applications. I also learned a good deal about various communication protocols.
