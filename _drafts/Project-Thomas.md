## Project Thomas
The goal of this project is to make a working full rgb "Discovery" era daft punk Thomas helmet. My portion of this project was mostly to create the pcb and ensure that they will work when delivered to the primary programmer of this project, Dave Stewart. 

### Background
This project in all honestly has been a very long time coming. Dave first mentioned his interest in recreating Thomas' daft punk helmet perhaps 5 years ago now. I've always had a strong interest in electronics, and I suggested he build a large led matrix of standard 3 mm red leds. This was probably rather naive of me because Dave is not the most comfortable person with soldering and there was *tons* of it to do.
