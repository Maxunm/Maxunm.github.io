### T-Shirt Press
The goal of this project is to make a working T-Shirt press in the style of the Cricut [Easy Press](https://cricut.com/en_us/cricut-easypress).
The project is still in it's early days but I will keep this post up-to date with the current status.

The idea came for this project when using a vinyl cutting machine. Thinking of how it would be nice to be able to
make T-Shirts with with it.
